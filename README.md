This repository contains Game AI sample code.

- AlphaBetaTwoGames shows how the exact same algorithm [the exact same code] is able multiple games as long as the games have two players who alternate turns and at most one player can win. The sample compares the [AlphaBeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning) pruning optimization to the [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves) algorith. See the [AlphaBetaTwoGames README](./AlphaBetaTwoGames/readme.md) for moe information.
- DesktopTowerDefense is a Unity3D project that demonstrates path finding. The project is a start toward making a 3D clone of an excellent but obsolete FLASH game, [Desktop Tower Defense](https://youtu.be/LlxoU09KLqw?t=12). AI controlled "meanies" try to navigate from left to right and top to bottom. Click in teh play area to build walls. The meanies use [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) to automatically adapt and find new paths around obstacles. A future version may adapt Dijkstra's Algorithm to use A* path finding. A* chnages from using a Queue to using a Priority Queue where priority is based on a huristic that adds an estimate of the cost of the remaining journey to the cost of the journey so far. If the estimate is accurate, A* is a much faster algorithm than Dijkstra's, but if the estimate is poor, A* can perform worse.
