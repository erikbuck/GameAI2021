THis repository contains Game AI sample code.

- AlphaBetaTwoGames shows how the exact same algorithm [the exact same code] is able multiple games as long as the games have two players who alternate turns and at most one player can win. The sample compares the [AlphaBeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning) pruning optimization to the [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves) algorith. See the [AlphaBetaTwoGames README](./AlphaBetaTwoGames/readme.md) for moe information.
